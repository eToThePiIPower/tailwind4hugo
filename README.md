# Tailwind4Hugo

**THIS IS AN INCOMPLETE ALPHA VERSION, PLEASE DO NOT USE THIS IN PRODUCTION**

A clean Hugo theme written in Tailwind CSS 4.
This is partially a port of my old Jekyll theme [Bootstrap4Jekyl](https://github.com/eToThePiIPower/bootstrap4jekyll),
with additional inspiration taken from  Guru Sabarish's [hugo-profile](https://github.com/gurusabarish/hugo-profile).

## Features

* Clean design in TailwindCSS 4.
* "Profile page" as front page
* Blog, tag, and category list pages

## Installation

Add to your themes folder as a submodule (this makes updating the theme
separately from your site easier)

```shell
git submodule add https://github.com/eToThePiIPower/tailwind4hugo themes/tailwind4hugo
```

Then add the theme to your `hugo.yaml` file:

```yaml
theme: 'tailwind4hugo'
```
